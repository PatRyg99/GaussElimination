# Gauss elimination for specific sparse matrices

Project for course "Scientific computations" written in Julia language.

This project implements gauss elimination algorithm optimized for certain type of sparse matrices (defined in task description).
Due to optimization to given task algorithm is linear in time O(n) instead of cubic O(n^3) as classic gauss elimination.
